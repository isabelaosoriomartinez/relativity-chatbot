(Lanceleaf RelativityOne)2020/08/15EnhancementARMBecause there are duplicated documents, there are 3 rows in File table (this is perfectly fine) pointing on the same file due to the fact that ARM during Move job uses \"\"Move\"\" method, the 2nd and the 3rd time ARM cannot find the file because it is already moved. Still update path method, does the path update (and file name update) in case of linked files always to file guide name. (that's why if original linked file was not guide named, it will be moved and renamed). (renaming linked files in case of changing them to repository files which mean copy them into repository is desired behavior because e.g. there can be already a file in repository with exactly same name, and the it would be overwritten or skipped, or cause error) There is also a mismatch in call to methods, so ARM creates batches not including processing files.

Relativity Customer Support and Engineering publishes known issues at its own discretion based criteria such as on the number of customer reports, the severity of the issue, and the availability of a workaround.

Documents processed using a Profile configured with such a time zone will reflect the correct date/time values within metadata fields and extracted text. However, the Relativity Native Time Zone Offset field is not set correctly, further causing inaccurate date/time rendering in the Native Viewer and Basic Imaging which both make use of this field.No2025-07-02REL-1136032Core - Relativity FormsWe have identified an issue where the pager component does not consistently appear on certain pages.

However, significant performance degradation is observed when the document list contains 200, 500, or 1000 items per page.*Cause:* The performance issues are identified to be related to the Relativity Documents list events, which become increasingly resource-intensive as the number of items per page increases.*Impact:* Users experience slow response times and potential timeouts when interacting with large document lists, affecting the overall usability and efficiency of the application.*Workaround:* Currently, there is no workaround available. Users are advised to limit the number of items per page to 100 or fewer to maintain optimal performance.Not Planned2025-03-21REL-1074072CollectDeleted Slack messages are not collected if their original post date falls outside the collection time frame, even if the deletion occurs within it.

This results in the mass operation confirmation number being smaller than the number of results on the list page itself. This only applies to conditions added using the filter pane; list conditions do not cause this behavior.Yes2025-03-12REL-1054669RDO FrameworkQueries referencing a saved search containing a relational field with an ad hoc search provider input applied will incorrectly apply the relational expansion both before and after the search provider filtering.

This issue does not occur when coding documents using the Checked option. The result of this workflow is the potential coding of incorrect documents.Expected outcome of this workflow: Document coding is applied to All (X) filtered documents.Actual outcome of this workflow: Document coding is applied to the top (X) documents in the unfiltered document list where (X) is the number of documents from the filtered list.Yes2024-09-12REL-997771Import APIOverlaying images with Links Only option, when the destination workspace contains the image physical file (for example, when moving documents from Review back to Repository workspace), will result in replacing the original image file with its link.

You can remove the default layout in the queue settings to resolve this in the meantime.Yes2024-07-24REL-959231RelativityOne RedactIn RelativityOne Redact, there is a code path within the application which attempts to size-down markups if it is determined that the markup has the potential to overlap adjacent lines of text for PDFs that were generated from images. This was intended to prevent unintentionally over-redacting text from the document beyond the drawn markup. However, this can result in intentionally drawn markups being resized below the actual text height.As a consequence of resolving this issue, the expected behavior is now that markup drawn outside of the bounding box of adjacent words or lines of text are no longer resized and have the potential to over-redact text from the document beyond the visually drawn markup.Yes2024-07-16REL-978454List PageThe first search run from the search bar after logging in to Relativity may not update the document list properly. The correct number of results are displayed, e.g. 1 - 100 of 1000, but the document list may not update to reflect those 1000 documents. Reloading the page will resolve the issue and after that, subsequent searches in the same session will update the document list as expected.Yes2024-07-15REL-978035List PageThe new permission for inline editing is visible in Relativity, but the feature has not yet been released.

(Foxglove Early Access)2019/04/24EnhancementADSThe MaxConcurrentWorkspaceUpgradesPerApplicationInstallerAgent instance setting has been removed. It was originally added to allow concurrent application installs within a single Application Installation Manager agent. We were hoping for less contention in the database by retrieving more workspaces per query and a speed improvement by running the installs concurrently. Since then we were able to reduce blocking in the query significantly, and we have found that multiple threads in an agent are no better than simply adding more agents. There was no longer a need for this capability. Without this setting, the recommended way for a Relativity administrator to speed up application installs is to add more Application Installation Manager agents. (Foxglove Early Access)2019/04/24EnhancementAuthenticationThe new DomainNameWhiteListUrls instance setting allows a system administrator to enter a semicolon-delimited list of domain names that can navigate users away from Relativity. If the URL is not on the white-list, the user will not be allowed to navigate to the external URL.
